Hi! I am a Ph.D. student at [Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence](http://ai.ruc.edu.cn), [Renmin University of China](https://www.ruc.edu.cn), where I am advised by Prof. [Yankai Lin](https://linyankai.github.io). Before that, I got my Master's degree at the Center for Data Science of Peking University. I was a member of [LANCO](https://lancopku.github.io) group, where I was advised by Prof. [Xu Sun](https://xusun.org). I am interested in Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP). Specifically, I am working on the robustness and security problems of large language models, and also federated machine learning problems (optimization & security).
